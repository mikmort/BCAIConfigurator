  "Table 98": "Table 98)\nThe General Ledger Setup is a single-record table that defines fundamental financial and global settings\nfor the company\u2019s ledger and other application areas. These settings impact how transactions post and how\ndata is presented. Below are key fields commonly reviewed:\nField\nDefault Value\nRecommended\nSetting\nConsiderations\nAllow Posting\nFrom / Allow\nPosting To\n01/01/20xx\nto \n12/31/20xx\n(or blank)\nSet to your open\nfiscal period\nrange\nDefines the date range in which users can\npost entries. Initially, this may be blank or set\nto the full fiscal year. It\u2019s recommended to\nupdate these dates to restrict posting to the \ncurrent open period (e.g. from the start of\nthe month/quarter to the end) and update as\nperiods close. This helps prevent accidental\nback-dating or future-dating of entries. You\ncan also set user-specific posting ranges in\nthe User Setup table for more control.\n2\nField\nDefault Value\nRecommended\nSetting\nConsiderations\nRegister\nTime\nOff (False)\nOff (usually)\nIf enabled, the system records a timestamp\non ledger entries when posting. Default is\noff. In the US, it\u2019s typically not needed to\ntrack exact times for G/L entries, so leaving\nthis off is fine unless auditing requires it.\nAllow\nDeferral\nPosting\nFrom/To\n(Blank)\nBlank or limit if\nusing Deferrals\nIf using Deferral templates (to spread\nrevenue/expenses), you can restrict the date\nrange for deferral postings. Commonly left\nblank (no restriction) unless you need to\nprevent deferrals beyond a certain date.\nLocal\nCurrency\n(LCY) Code\n(Blank)\nUSD\nSet your local currency code. For a US\ncompany this is \u201cUSD\u201d (US Dollar). This is\ncritical for multi-currency scenarios and for\nrounding precision settings. Once\ntransactions exist, changing LCY is not\nrecommended.\nEMU\nCurrency\nOff (False)\nOff (True only if\nin EMU region)*\nApplicable mainly in EU countries using the\nEuro. In the US, leave this off.\nAdditional\nReporting\nCurrency\n(Blank)\nIf needed\nIf you require financial reporting in another\ncurrency (e.g. parent company currency),\nspecify it here. Typically left blank for US\ncompanies unless a secondary currency is\nrequired.\nAmount\nDecimal\nPlaces\n2:2\n2:2 (for USD)\nControls how many decimal places amounts\nare shown with. The default \u201c2:2\u201d means\nalways show 2 decimal places (e.g. $1.00). In\nthe US, currency has two decimals, so use\n2:2. Only adjust if you need a different\nprecision for LCY.\nUnit-Amount\nDecimal\nPlaces\n2:2\n2:2 (or 2:5 for\nmore)\nDefault is 2:2 (two decimals) for unit prices.\nYou could use a range (e.g. 2:5) if item prices\nrequire more precision (up to 5 decimal\nplaces) \u2013 e.g. gasoline per gallon might need\n3 decimals. Keep minimum 2 for currency.\nAmount\nRounding\nPrecision\n0.01\n0.01\nSmallest currency unit for rounding amounts.\n$0.01 (one cent) is standard for USD. Do not\nchange unless dealing with a currency that\nhas a different minor unit.\n3\nField\nDefault Value\nRecommended\nSetting\nConsiderations\nInvoice\nRounding\nPrecision\n(LCY)\n1.00 (or 0.01)\n0.01 or 1.00\nInvoice Rounding is used to round invoice\ntotals to a certain increment. Many U.S.\ncompanies don\u2019t use invoice-level rounding,\nso this can be set to $0.01 (effectively no\nspecial rounding). If set to $1.00 with\nrounding type = Nearest, the system would\nround total to the nearest dollar \u2013 not typical\nin the US. Generally leave at 0.01.\nInvoice\nRounding\nType (LCY)\nNearest\nNearest\nIf invoice rounding precision is >0.01, defines\nrounding direction. \u201cNearest\u201d is standard\n(round .5 up). In the US, since precision is\nusually $0.01, this setting has little effect. If\nusing $1.00 precision (not common), Nearest\nwill round .50 and above up. Other options\nare Up (always round up) or Down (always\ndown).\nSummarize\nG/L Entries\nOff (False)\nOff (or On per\npreference)\nIf On, the system will summarize G/L\npostings from a document into one line per\naccount (reducing detail in G/L). Default is off\nto preserve line-by-line detail. Recommended\nto leave Off for detailed audit trails. Turn On\nonly if you want condensed ledger entries\n(e.g. to reduce G/L entry count).\nMark Cr.\nMemos as\nCorrections\nOn (True)\nOn\nIf true, sales/purchase credit memos are\nmarked as corrective documents, which\ncauses them to post with opposite signs and\nlink to original invoices. Default is on.\nRecommended to keep enabled \u2013 it facilitates\nnetting credits with invoices in reports and is\nstandard accounting treatment for negative\ninvoices.\nAllow G/L\nAcc. Deletion\nBefore\n(Blank)\nSet a cut-off date\nIf blank, there\u2019s no restriction on deleting G/L\naccounts. It\u2019s wise to set this to a date far in\nthe past (or the company\u2019s creation date) to \nblock deletion of any G/L account that has\nentries on or before that date. For example,\nset 01/01/1900 or 01/01/2020 to effectively\nprevent deleting accounts that have been\nused. This helps maintain data integrity.\n4\nField\nDefault Value\nRecommended\nSetting\nConsiderations\nBlock\nDeletion of\nG/L Accounts\nOff\nOn\nWhen enabled, the system prevents\ndeletion of any G/L account that has ever\nbeen posted to. It\u2019s strongly recommended\nto turn this On (True) in production, to avoid\naccidental loss of financial history.\nRetained\nEarnings\nAccount\n(fields for\nBalance\nSheet/Income\nStatements)\n(Blank)\nSet account\nschedule or\nfinancial report\ncodes\nThese fields (Acc. Sched. for Retained Earn.,\nFin. Rep. for Retained Earn.) let you specify\nwhich account schedule or financial\nstatement defines retained earnings closing.\nThese are often left blank in US, as retained\nearnings is usually handled via the year-end\nclosing entry. If using account schedules to\ncalculate retained earnings, set the code\nhere. Otherwise, leave blank and manage via\nclose process.\nGlobal\nDimension 1\nCode / Global\nDimension 2\nCode\n(Blank)\ne.g.\nDEPARTMENT, \nPROJECT\nChoose the two most-used Dimensions to be\n\u201cGlobal,\u201d meaning they are available on every\nentry and can be filtered on most reports.\nCommon choices in the US: Department,\nProject, Business Unit, etc. Decide early \u2013\nchanging later requires data transformation.\nThese fields will populate dimension filters in\nmany pages.\nShortcut\nDimension\n3-8 Codes\n(Blank)\nOther frequent\ndimensions\nYou can have up to 8 Shortcut Dimensions\n(including the 2 globals). Assign codes for\ndimensions 3-8 if you have more than two\ndimensions to track (they won\u2019t be global\nfilters but are available on entries). If you\nonly use two dimensions, leave others blank.\n5\nField\nDefault Value\nRecommended\nSetting\nConsiderations\nVAT (Tax)\nSettings\n(various fields)\n(Defaults vary)\nSee below\nBusiness Central uses \u201cVAT\u201d fields for tax\nlogic. In the US, Sales Tax is managed\ndifferently (using Tax Areas and Tax\nJurisdictions), but some VAT fields still play a\nrole: <ul><li>VAT Bus. Posting Group/Prod.\nPosting Group: In US, typically you set all\ncustomers and items to a generic group (e.g.\nTAXABLE/ NONTAX) or leave blank and use\ntax area codes instead. If using BC\u2019s sales tax,\nensure Tax Area Code and Tax Liable (on\ncustomer/vendor) are set appropriately; VAT\ngroups might not be used.</\nli><li>Unrealized VAT: Off by default. Not\nused for US sales tax.</li><li>VAT Tolerance\n% / Max.

In US, the typical format\nis City, State ZIP. Choose an available format\n(City+State+ZIP) for consistency.\nRequire\nCountry/\nRegion Code\nin Address\nOff (False)\nOff (for US\ndomestic focus)\nWhen enabled, if a Country/Region Code is\nspecified on an address, the City/State/ZIP\nwill reformat based on that country\u2019s format.\nIn a US-only context, this can be off. If you do\ninternational business and want to ensure\ncountry is always included and formatted,\nyou could enable it.\nLocal\nCurrency\nSymbol/\nDescription\n(Blank)\n$ / US Dollar\nOptional: Set how the local currency symbol\nand name appear on reports. E.g. \u201c$\u201d and \u201cUS\nDollar\u201d. If blank, system may use currency\ncode. Setting these makes reports clearer\n(e.g. showing $ on invoices).\nBank\nAccount Nos.\n(Varies)\nReview default or\nset new\nThis specifies the No. Series Code for\nnumbering Bank Accounts. A default series\n(e.g. BANK) might be pre-filled via\ndemonstration data. Ensure it exists and\nmeets your format, or set up a new no. series\ncode and assign it here.\n6\nField\nDefault Value\nRecommended\nSetting\nConsiderations\nBank Recon.\nwith Auto\nMatch\nOn (True)\nOn (if using\nPayment Rec.\nJournal)\nIf enabled, bank reconciliation is done via the\nPayment Reconciliation Journal (with auto-\nimport/match of bank statements). If off,\nuses the manual Bank Rec. Worksheet. Most\nmodern setups keep this On to leverage\nautomated matching. Turn off only if your\nclient prefers the legacy bank rec process\n(e.g. for check-heavy environments).\nEnable Data\nCheck\nOff (False)\nOn (typically)\nThis setting, when On, validates data on\ndocuments/journals in real-time and shows\nmessages in the Document/Journal Check\nFactBox. It helps catch issues before posting.\nIt\u2019s often enabled in new BC versions.\nRecommend turning it On to aid users in\ncatching errors (e.g. missing dimensions,\noverstated amounts, etc.).\nAdditional General Ledger Setup considerations: Other fields in GL Setup include  Notification toggles for\nbackground posting (used if posting via Job Queue), various Tolerance and Discount Posting options (how\nto handle payment tolerances or discount grace periods), and  Report Output Type (if using Job Queue\nposting+printing).  These  typically  default  to  sensible  values  and  can  be  left  unless  specific  business\nscenarios require change. For example, Payment Tolerance %/Max Amount default to 0 (no tolerance),\nwhich is often fine; if the client allows minor payment differences to auto-write-off, set a small percentage\nor amount and choose whether to post to a tolerance account.\nSales & Receivables Setup (",
  "Table 311": "Table 311)\nThe Sales & Receivables Setup table governs how sales processes (quotes, orders, invoices, etc.) function.\nIt includes defaults for sales documents, customer interactions, and numbering.

This helps salespeople catch risk:\nan overdue customer or one over their limit\nwill trigger a message (but it doesn\u2019t block\nposting by default). Ensure you\u2019ve set credit\nlimits on customer cards for this to be\nmeaningful.\n8\nField\nDefault\nValue\nRecommended\nSetting\nConsiderations\nStockout Warning\nOn (True)\nOn (True)\nIf enabled, the user gets a warning when\nadding a sales line that would make the\nitem\u2019s inventory go negative. Default is True.\nRecommended to keep On so users are\naware of potential backorders/stock issues.\n(Note: If you allow negative inventory, this is\njust a warning; actual prevention of\nnegative inventory is set in Inventory\nSetup.)\nShipment on\nInvoice\nOn (True)\nOn or per\nprocess\nWhen On, posting a sales Invoice will\nautomatically post the shipment as well.\nDefault is often on, allowing \u201cinvoice&ship\u201d\nin one step. Recommended to leave On for\nsimplicity if the client\u2019s process is to invoice\norders directly (common for non-warehouse\nscenarios). If they separate warehouse\nshipping from invoicing, set Off \u2013 this will\nrequire posting shipments first, then\ninvoices.\nInvoice Rounding\nOff (False)\nOff (usually)\nControls whether the system applies\ninvoice-level rounding to the sales invoice\ntotal. Typically off in US, since pricing and\nsales tax already round each line and sum\nexactly. If turned on, ensure you set Inv.\nRounding Precision (LCY) in GL Setup (e.g.\n$0.01 or $1.00) and have a Sales Rounding\nAccount specified (in Sales Posting Setup or\na specific G/L). Most US businesses keep this\nOff.\nExt. Doc. No.\nMandatory\nOff (False)\nOff (for sales)\nIf enabled, the External Document No.\n(e.g. customer\u2019s PO number) is required on\nsales invoices and credit memos. In many\nUS businesses this is optional \u2013 set to On\nonly if the client wants to enforce capturing\ncustomer PO/reference numbers on every\ninvoice.

Recommended to keep Work\nDate unless there\u2019s a reason to force\nmanual entry (e.g. always need specific\nbackdating). Using Work Date helps ensure\nposting date = current date, but users\nshould still adjust if needed for period-end\npostings.\nDefault Quantity\nto Ship\nRemaining\n(implied)\nRemaining\nSets the default for the Qty. to Ship on\nsales orders (and Return Qty. to Receive on\nreturn orders). If \u201cRemaining,\u201d the system\nauto-fills the full quantity not yet shipped\nwhen you create or refresh a shipment. If\nset to Blank, the field will stay zero and\nrequire manual entry for each line.\nGenerally, Remaining is recommended so\nthat when you post a shipment or invoice,\nall lines are picked up by default. Leave it\nblank only if users need to explicitly enter\nship quantities (e.g. partial shipments by\ndefault).\n10\nField\nDefault\nValue\nRecommended\nSetting\nConsiderations\nCustomer Nos.\n(and other No. Series\nfields)\n(Preset series\ncodes)\nReview/Adjust\nseries\nThese fields link to the Number Series for\nvarious sales-related records.

Ensure each points to a valid No.\nSeries with an appropriate starting format\n(e.g. CUST-10000, SO-0001). Update the\nseries if the client has a specific numbering\npreference (like using year prefixes, etc.).\nRemember to also set up Return Order\nNos. and Posted Return Receipt Nos. for\nreturn orders (not visible above but present\nin the table). If a field is blank, assign a\nseries or create one.\nCalc. Inv. Discount\nOn (True)\nOn (True)\nIf enabled, invoice discounts (based on the\nCustomer\u2019s Invoice Disc. terms) are\nautomatically calculated on sales\ndocuments. Typically True by default. Keep \nOn if using invoice discount terms so the\nsystem auto-calculates the discount when\nthe order total qualifies. If the client doesn\u2019t\nuse invoice-level discounts at all, it can be\noff (no impact).\n11\nField\nDefault\nValue\nRecommended\nSetting\nConsiderations\nApplication\nbetween\nCurrencies\nNone\nNone or All\nControls whether you can apply customer\npayments to entries in different currencies.\nOptions:<ul><li>None \u2013 cannot apply across\ncurrencies (USD invoices can only be applied\nto USD payments).</li><li>EMU \u2013 can apply\nEuro and legacy currencies (for EMU\ncountries; not relevant in US).</li><li>All \u2013\ncan apply any currency to any (the system\nwill consider equivalent amounts).</li></\nul>Default is None. For US companies, set\nto All only if you foresee scenarios of\napplying, say, a CAD payment to a USD\ninvoice (rare). Typically keep at None to\navoid unintentional cross-currency\nadjustments.\nCopy Comments\nBlanket\u2192Order / \nOrder\u2192Invoice / \nOrder\u2192Shipment\nOff (False)\nfor all\nAs needed\nThese toggles control if comments from one\ndocument type are automatically copied to\nthe next in the chain. For example, if Copy\nComments Order to Invoice = On, any\ncomments on a Sales Order will carry over\nto the Sales Invoice. Default is off.\nRecommended to turn On for any stage\nwhere you want internal or external\ncomments to flow through. Commonly,\nOrder\u2192Invoice is enabled so that any notes\non the order (like special instructions)\nappear on the invoice. Blanket\u2192Order and\nOrder\u2192Shipment are used if those\ndocument types are used heavily and notes\nare important.\nAllow VAT\nDifference\nOff (False)\nOff (for US)\nAllows manual adjustment of VAT amounts\non sales documents. Not applicable to US\nsales tax \u2013 leave Off. (In VAT scenarios,\nturning this on lets users edit the VAT\namount if rounding differences occur. For\nUS sales tax, differences are handled via tax\narea setup, not manual changes.)\n12\nField\nDefault\nValue\nRecommended\nSetting\nConsiderations\nShipping Advice\n(on orders)\nComplete\n(default on\norders)\nPer order\nShipping Advice isn\u2019t a field in S&R Setup, but\na default on sales orders (\u201cPartial\u201d vs\n\u201cComplete\u201d shipment allowed). By default,\nnew sales orders allow Partial shipments.\nYou might advise setting the default to \nPartial (so you can ship whatever is\navailable) unless the business requires all\nitems to ship together (Complete). This\nsetting is found on the Sales Order itself or\nin an Order Template rather than in S&R\nSetup. Partners often ensure the default is\n\u201cPartial\u201d for flexibility.\nArchiving Settings\n\u2013 Archive Quotes, \nArchive Orders, \nArchive Return\nOrders\nOn (True)\nfor Quotes; \nOff for\nothers\nOn where\nneeded\nThese settings control automatic archiving\nof sales documents when they are deleted\nor processed. For example, if Archive\nOrders = On, when a sales order is posted\nor deleted, a copy is saved in Archives. By\ndefault, BC may enable archive for Quotes\n(so you don\u2019t lose rejected quotes) and leave\nOrders off. It\u2019s recommended to turn On for\nOrders and Return Orders as well, to\nmaintain an audit trail of changes and\nposted documents. There is minimal\ndownside, aside from database size, which\nis usually negligible.\nDefault G/L\nAccount Quantity\nOff (False)\nOn if desired\n(Added in 2024) When On, if you add a line\nof type G/L Account on a sales document,\nthe Quantity will default to 1 instead of 0.\nThis is useful for companies that often sell\nG/L-based charges or services \u2013 it saves a\nstep of entering \u201c1\u201d manually for each line.\nTurn On if users will benefit from a default\nquantity of 1 on G/L lines; otherwise leave \nOff (especially if you prefer to enter specific\nquantities, or often use G/L lines for misc.\nwhere quantity isn\u2019t needed).\n13\nField\nDefault\nValue\nRecommended\nSetting\nConsiderations\nDocument Default\nLine Type\nItem\n(typically)\nItem (or as\nneeded)\nSets the default Type on the first line of new\nsales documents. Options include Item, G/L\nAccount, Resource, Fixed Asset, Charge\n(Item), or Blank. In BC 2021+ this is an\nenum. By default it might be Item (since\nmost sales involve items). You should set\nthis to whatever the client most frequently\nsells:<ul><li>Service-oriented business with\nno inventory: choose G/L Account or \nResource to default lines to services.</\nli><li>Asset sales: Fixed Asset if selling\nassets often (rare).</li><li>For inventory-\nbased companies: Item (the usual choice).</\nli></ul>If unsure, leave as Item \u2013 users can\nstill change line type manually. This just\nsaves clicks by defaulting the drop-down on\nnew lines.\nCreate Item from\nDescription\nOff (False)\nOff (usually)\nIf enabled and a user enters a Description\non a sales line without specifying an item,\nthe system will prompt to create a new Item\ncard from that description. Default is off.\nRecommend Off to avoid accidentally\ncreating many one-off items. Enable only if\nthe business process is to allow quick item\ncreation on the fly by typing a new item\nname in orders (uncommon).\nCreate Item from\nItem No.\nOff (False)\nOff (usually)\nSimilar to above: if enabled, typing a new\n(unrecognized) item number on a sales line\nwill prompt to create a new item with that\nnumber. Default off. Typically leave Off to\nmaintain control via item cards. Turn on\nonly if users will create new item master\nrecords directly during order entry.\nCopy Customer\nName to Entries\nOn (True)\nOn\nIf on, when posting, the customer\u2019s name is\ncopied to the G/L and customer ledger\nentries. Default is True. Keep On so\nhistorical entries retain the customer name\n(even if the customer record\u2019s name\nchanges later). This aids in auditing.\n14\nField\nDefault\nValue\nRecommended\nSetting\nConsiderations\nDisable Search by\nName\nOff (False)\nOff (usually)\nIf enabled, you can change the Customer\nName on sales documents without\nupdating the actual Customer Card (it treats\nit as a one-time override). Default off,\nmeaning any name change on a sales order\nupdates the customer card\u2019s name. Usually\nleave Off so that users don\u2019t inadvertently\nrename customers via orders. If a user\nneeds a different \u201cShip-to Name,\u201d they\nshould use the Ship-to Address functionality\nrather than editing the Bill-to Name.\nAllow Multiple\nPosting Groups\nOff (False)\nOff (typically)\nControls whether a single customer can use\nmultiple customer posting groups on\ndifferent documents.

Other\noptions: Daily, Monthly, Quarterly, or Never.\nFor most small/mid companies, Always is fine\n(default). If performance issues arise with\nlarge item ledgers, consider switching to Daily\nor Monthly \u2013 which will limit how far back in\ntime the automatic adjustment looks for cost\nchanges.

Day gives the most\ngranularity and is recommended in most cases\nfor up-to-date costing. Using longer periods\n(Month, etc.) can simplify calculations but may\ndistort interim margins (because cost changes\nwithin the month wouldn\u2019t reflect until period\nend). For US GAAP, daily (or even per\ntransaction which \u201cDay\u201d effectively achieves)\naverage is typically acceptable and gives\nprecise COGS. So we suggest keep Day unless\na specific reason to use Monthly (e.g. to reduce\ncost adjustment frequency, but that\u2019s less of an\nissue with modern hardware).\nDefault\nCosting\nMethod\nFIFO (or \nAverage)\nFIFO (commonly)\nThe costing method that will be default when\nnew items are created. Common choices: FIFO,\nAverage, LIFO, Specific, Standard. In a US\ndistribution context, FIFO is widely used (first-\nin, first-out valuation). If the client uses\nStandard Cost (common in manufacturing),\nyou might set that as default and maintain\nstandard costs on items. Average is\nsometimes used for commodities or pooling\ncosts (ensuring cost of item is always weighted\naverage). LIFO is rare (and not compliant for\nIFRS, though allowed in US tax, it\u2019s seldom\nused in systems due to layered tracking\ncomplexity). Specific is used when each item\nunit\u2019s cost is tracked (requires serial numbers\nor lot costing). Recommendation: Set the\ndefault to the method most of their items will\nuse (e.g. FIFO for trading companies, Standard\nfor mfg with stable costs, Average if they\nprefer smoothing). FIFO is a safe default if\nunsure, as it\u2019s common and straightforward.\nNote this is just a default for item card creation\n\u2013 each item can be changed individually after\ncreation.\n29\nField\nDefault\nValue\nRecommended\nSetting\nConsiderations\nAllow\nNegative\nInventory\nOn (True)\nOff or On per policy\nThis field (called Prevent Negative Inventory\nin older versions when reversed) determines\nwhether the system allows posting an item\nbelow zero on hand. If allowed (Prevent\nNegative = False), you can ship items even if\ninventory is zero/negative; inventory will go\nnegative and later receipts will adjust. If not\nallowed, BC will block posting that would cause\nnegative. In the US, many small businesses\nallow negative inventory for practicality (ship\nnow, receive later). However, best practice is \nnot to allow negative inventory (set Prevent\nNegative = True) to maintain accurate\ninventory records. The decision depends on\nclient operations: <ul><li>If they have good\ninventory control and want accuracy, set \nPrevent Negative Inventory = On (i.e. do \nNOT allow negatives).</li><li>If they\noccasionally need to ship before item receipt is\nrecorded (and are okay with temporary\nnegative stock), leave it allowed (Off). They will\nneed to manage those carefully to avoid cost\nissues.</li></ul> Be cautious: negative\ninventory can lead to costing issues (BC will\nguess at cost, then adjust later). Our\nrecommendation: disable negative inventory\nfor better data integrity, unless there\u2019s a\nstrong need.\nLocation\nMandatory\nOff\n(False)\nOn if multi-loc\nIf enabled, every inventory transaction must\nspecify a Location Code. Default is off. If the\ncompany uses multiple warehouses or stores,\nit\u2019s wise to turn Location Mandatory = On so\nnothing can be posted without a location. If\nthey have only one location or don\u2019t track stock\nby location, leave it off (no harm). For multi-\nsite clients, definitely turn it On to avoid\n\u201cundefined\u201d location inventory.\n30\nField\nDefault\nValue\nRecommended\nSetting\nConsiderations\nLot\nWarehouse\nTracking\nOff\n(False)\nOff\n(Applicable if using directed warehouse) \u2013\nControls if lot/serial tracking is enforced at\nwarehouse pick level.

Default is \nOptional \u2013 users can manually reserve\ninventory to orders. Keep at Optional for\nflexibility unless the client wants to Always\nenforce reservations or disallow entirely\n(Never). Optional is standard.\nNew Item\nNos.\n(Blank or\na series)\nSet if using Item\ncreation from contacts\nIf using the \u201cCreate Item from Description/No.\u201d\nfeatures, BC can auto-number those new items\nusing this series. If blank, it will prompt user\nfor item number. It\u2019s often blank by default\nsince many companies plan item numbering. If\nthe client will use quick item create (e.g. from\nsales docs), define a series here (like MISC-\n#####). Otherwise, leave blank (forcing\nmanual assignment for new items via normal\nprocess).\nDefault\nWarehouse\nHandling\nTime\n0D\nEnter if using order\npromising\nIf the company wants to include a default\ninternal handling time for warehouse in\ndelivery date calculations (order promising),\nset a value (e.g. 1D = 1 day). This works with \nAvailable to Promise date calculations.\nDefault is none. If lead times are tracked at\nitem/vendor level, this might not be needed\nglobally.\nCombination\nof SKU and\nLocation\nMandatory\nOff\nOff\nThere is also a setting controlling if\nStockkeeping Unit records are required for\nitems at locations. Typically not mandatory\nunless they want to force use of SKUs. Leave as\ndefault (off).\n31\nNote: Many  Inventory  Setup  fields  revolve  around  costing  and  financial  impact.  The  above\nrecommendations ensure that cost postings are automatic and real-time, which is usually preferred. If\nperformance becomes an issue with cost adjustment, switch Automatic Cost Adjustment to a less frequent\nsetting (e.g. Daily) but schedule the Adjust Cost batch job off-hours. Also, after initial configuration, test a\nfull purchase\u2192shipment\u2192invoice cycle with inventory to verify that interim postings and adjustments\nbehave as expected (especially if expected cost = on and negative inventory possibly allowed \u2013 you want to\nensure COGS adjusts properly when actual cost arrives).\nWarehouse Setup (",

Also remember to configure each Location Card\nwith appropriate settings: e.g. mark specific locations as Require Receipt, Require Shipment, Use Bins,\nDirected Pick/Put-away, etc., as that overrides or complements the global settings.

Backward is recommended if\ninventory is reasonably accurate and you want\neasier processing. If the client wants tighter\ncontrol or uses actual picking before\nproduction, they might choose Manual (for\nexplicit consumption entries) or Forward (if they\nissue all material at start). But Backward is\ngenerally the best starting point for automatic\nconsumption**. (Note: flushing method can be\noverridden per item on its Manufacturing\nFastTab, this is just the default for new items.)\nDefault\nFinishing\nMethod\n(Output)\nManual\n(implicitly)\nManual\nThere\u2019s also output flushing, but by default\noutput (finished goods) is always posted\nmanually via output journal or production order\noutput. BC doesn\u2019t auto-flush output; you must\nrecord output quantity. So there\u2019s no direct field\nfor output flush here (the \u201cPreset Output\nQuantity\u201d option exists but is rarely changed).\nKeep the standard approach: users report\noutput manually.\n36\nField\nDefault\nValue\nRecommended\nSetting\nConsiderations\nNormal Starting\nTime / Normal\nEnding Time\n07:00 / \n15:30 (for\nexample)\nCompany work\nday times\nThese define the default work day start and end\ntime for finite capacity scheduling. E.g., 7:00 AM\nto 3:30 PM by default in Cronus. Set these to the\nplant\u2019s typical shift times (e.g., 08:00 to 17:00\nfor an 8-5 schedule). This is used when\nscheduling operations on the shop calendar if\nno specific shop calendar is given. Adjust to\nmatch actual working hours for realistic\nscheduling.\nDynamic Low-\nLevel Code\nOff (False)\nOff or On for\ncomplex prod.\nIf On, the system dynamically updates the low-\nlevel code of BOMs when BOMs change\n(ensuring proper MRP explosion levels). If off,\nyou can run a batch to update LL codes. In most\ncases leave On (was False historically for\nperformance). If the client has deep BOMs and\nfrequent changes, On ensures planning\nrespects new structure. For small companies,\nperformance impact is negligible, so enabling it\nis fine.\nComponents at\nLocation\n(Blank)\nBlank or a\nspecific code\nIf filled, this forces all production order\ncomponent consumption to be taken from a\nsingle location code regardless of the\nproduction order\u2019s location. Usually blank\n(meaning use the production order\u2019s location\nfor components). Keep blank unless there\u2019s a\nscenario like all components are at a central\nstock location while production output is\nposted at another \u2013 rare. Usually each plant has\nits own components.\nPlanning\nWarning\nOn (True)\nOn\nIf enabled, the system will display warnings\nduring planning worksheet calculations for\nissues (like if planning parameters are\ninconsistent).

If they forecast just\nitem totals, leave these off.\nDefault\nDampener\nPeriod / Default\nDampener %\n0D / 0\nSet moderate\nvalues\nThe dampener period is a horizon (e.g. 7D for\na week) within which the system will not\nsuggest rescheduling existing orders \u2013 to avoid\nnervousness (constant reschedule suggestions)\nfor near-term. Default 0 means no dampening\nby period. A typical setting might be 7D or 14D\nto freeze the next week or two of production\nschedule from trivial changes. Dampener %\nsimilarly prevents suggestions to change\nquantity by small percentages \u2013 if change is\nwithin this %, system may ignore. Default 0\nmeans even small changes will trigger an action\nmessage. If minor changes are bothersome, set\nmaybe 5% or 10%. We recommend setting a\nDampener Period of at least a few days\n(according to how rigid their schedule is) \u2013 e.g. \n7D \u2013 so that once an order is close, planning\nwon\u2019t keep moving it. Dampener % could be\nperhaps 5 (meaning <5% quantity difference\nwon\u2019t suggest change).

Otherwise, those costs would not roll into\nthe item\u2019s value (and you\u2019d treat them as period\nexpenses).

Posting\nGroup (for\nProduction\nOrders)\n(Blank)\nSet if needed\nThis sets a default General Business Posting\nGroup on new Production Orders for their\noutput transactions. If blank, the production\noutput uses the Gen. Bus. Posting Group of\nwhoever/whatever is defined on output (often\nnot relevant since output posts to inventory\naccounts via inventory posting group). Some\ncompanies may set a dummy \u201cPROD\u201d business\ngroup if they want production output to hit\nspecific sales accounts (not typical). In most\ncases, leave blank; it will derive from the\nCustomer/Vendor if needed in consumption of\nsubcontracting. Not heavily used \u2013 you can\nignore unless advised otherwise.\nPreset Output\nQuantity\nNo\n(probably\nan option\nlike None)\nNone\nThis is an option field (likely Yes/No or By Item)\nto automatically prefill the output quantity on\nproduction orders. Default is not to preset.\nTypically, leave as is (manual entry of output is\nsafer).\n40\nNote: Manufacturing Setup often comes with good defaults. The key is to align with the client\u2019s production\nmanagement style. After configuring, test a scenario: create a production order, consume materials (auto\nflush or manual as set), post output, and ensure costs and outputs flow as expected. For planning (MRP/\nMPS),  verify  that  forecast  usage,  dampeners,  and  lead  times  produce  sensible  action  messages.\nManufacturing is complex, so these settings might be revisited after initial runs.\nFixed Assets Setup (",

In  the  US,  you  might  have  a  \u201cBOOK\u201d  depreciation  (for  books/GAAP)  and  a  \u201cTAX\u201d\ndepreciation book (no G/L integration, for tracking tax depreciation like MACRS). The FA Posting Groups\nalso need setup \u2013 map assets to balance sheet accounts (cost, accumulated depreciation) and income\nstatement (depreciation expense, gains/losses). Ensure those are configured before starting to acquire\nassets. The FA Setup mostly ensures numbering and basic rules are in place. Test by creating a fake asset,\nposting an acquisition cost, and running depreciation to see that it hits the right accounts.\nMarketing Setup (",

  "Table 308": "Table 308 and 309)\nThroughout the above setups, we referenced various Number Series. It\u2019s important to ensure all required\nnumber series are created (in No. Series table) with appropriate No. Series Lines defining starting/ending\nnumbers. Below is a summary of typical series to check in a US Business Central implementation:\n47\nSeries\nCode\nPurpose\nDefault\nFormat\n(Example)\nRecommended Setup\nConsiderations\nCUST\nCustomer\nNos.\nC-10000\u2026\nPrefix with a letter (C or CU) to\ndistinguish customer IDs from\nothers. Ensure Default Nos. = Yes\n(BC will auto-assign next customer\nnumber) and Manual Nos. = No (to\nprevent user overrides, unless\ndesired). Starting No. should have\nenough padding (e.g. C-00001 or\n10000) for expected count of\ncustomers.\nVEND\nVendor\nNos.\nV-10000\u2026\nSimilar approach as customers. If the\nclient has existing vendor IDs, you\nmight import those and then\ncontinue a sequence. Otherwise, use\na prefix like V-. Default Nos. typically\nYes, Manual Nos. maybe allowed if\nthey want to assign certain vendors a\nspecific ID.\nITEM\nItem Nos.\n1000\u2026 or\nPROD-0001\u2026\nItem numbering can vary widely.\nMany companies use all-numeric. If\nso, ensure the Starting No. is a\nnumber large enough (e.g. 10000). If\nthey use categories or manual\nmeaningful numbers, you might set\nManual Nos. = Yes and Default Nos. =\nNo, and use templates to assign. If\nauto, pick a format (with or without\nprefix) that suits them. Make sure to\ncover both inventory and non-\ninventory items (often one series is\nfine).\n48\nSeries\nCode\nPurpose\nDefault\nFormat\n(Example)\nRecommended Setup\nConsiderations\nSO (Sales\nOrder)\nSales Order\nNos.\nSO-0001\u2026\nPrefix with SO or use numeric range\ndistinct from purchase. Default Nos.\nYes (so each new order gets next\nnumber). Manual usually No (you\ndon\u2019t want salespeople picking order\nnumbers). Ensure the Posted\nShipment Nos. and Posted Invoice\nNos. have their own series\n(commonly PS- for posted shipment,\nand SI- or INV- for posted invoices).\nOften, Posted Invoice Nos. can\nshare a series with sales invoices if\ndesired or be separate \u2013 many use\none sequence for all posted sales\ninvoices. Make sure it\u2019s clear to the\nclient what numbering they prefer\nfor posted documents (some want\nthe same number as the order, but\nBC out of the box doesn\u2019t reuse order\nnumbers for invoices \u2013 it makes new\nones). Usually, keep them separate\nfor full traceability.\nPO\n(Purchase\nOrder)\nPurchase\nOrder Nos.\nPO-0001\u2026\nSimilar logic to SO. Distinct prefix to\navoid confusion with sales. Posted\nReceipt Nos. and Posted Invoice Nos.\nlikewise \u2013 often PR- for receipts, PI-\nfor posted purchase invoices. Some\ncompanies align purchase invoice\nnumber with vendor\u2019s invoice\nnumber instead, but those vendor\ninvoice numbers go in External Doc.\nNo., not as our primary key. So we\nstill need our own PI sequence for\nposted purchases. Ensure Allow\nGaps in Nos. is checked if required\nby audit (some jurisdictions require\nno gaps in invoice numbers \u2013 US is\ngenerally fine with gaps, but check if\nany requirement; BC by default\nallows gaps but records voids via No.\nSeries List).\n49\nSeries\nCode\nPurpose\nDefault\nFormat\n(Example)\nRecommended Setup\nConsiderations\nSHIP (or \nWH-SHIP)\nWarehouse\nShipment\nNos.\nWHS-0001\u2026\nIf using warehouse docs, prefix with\nWH or similar. Typically shorter\nsequences since internal. Ensure\nthese series have Default Nos. = Yes\nand Manual = No (you want system\nto assign).\nBANK\nBank\nAccount\nNos.\nBANK-0001\u2026\nFor internal bank accounts (the\nCompany\u2019s bank accounts), if many, a\nseries can be used. Many\norganizations assign bank codes\nmanually (like CHASE, BOFA1, etc.,\nmeaningful). If they prefer\nmeaningful, set Manual Nos = Yes.\nOtherwise, an auto number is fine.\nNot a high-volume record so either\nway is okay.\nFA\nFixed Asset\nNos.\nFA-0001\u2026\nAs discussed, if numbering assets\nsequentially. Some companies use\ncategories like VEH-0001 for vehicles,\nEQUIP- for equipment. BC can\u2019t do\nmultiple sequences out of the box\nwithout custom code or manual\nnumbering. If they strongly want\ndifferent formats per asset class,\nconsider Manual = Yes and let them\nenter (with guidance). Otherwise use\none sequence. If using one sequence\nbut wanting classification, you can\nincorporate a bit (like FA-V0001 vs FA-\nE0001 as separate series for vehicle\nvs equipment \u2013 possible by having\ntwo series and picking at creation,\nbut BC can only auto-default one\nseries in FA Setup). Decide based on\nclient preference.\n50\nSeries\nCode\nPurpose\nDefault\nFormat\n(Example)\nRecommended Setup\nConsiderations\nSERVICE\n(or SVO, \nSVR)\nService\nOrder Nos.\nSVO-0001\u2026\nEnsure series for Service Order,\nService Contract, Service Quote as\nneeded. If not using Service, no\nneed. If using, likely want a prefix to\ndistinguish from sales orders (since\nservice orders might look similar to\nsales orders). E.g. SRO or SVC.\nMISC (for\ntemplates)\ne.g. Item\nTemplate\nNos.\nT-0001\u2026\nIf using the feature to auto-create\nrecords from templates (like Default\nItem from description), have a series\nfor those ad-hoc creations. For\nexample, if sales can create a new\nitem on the fly, assign something like\nMISC-1000 series to differentiate\nthose items. Similarly, if auto-\ncreating Customer/Vendor from\nContacts, series should already be\nCUST/VEND as above.\nWhen defining number series lines, set a sufficiently large  Ending No. (e.g. \u201cC-99999\u201d or \u201cC-ZZZZZ\u201d if\nalphanumeric) to allow growth. The  Last No. Used will update as numbers are assigned.  Default Nos.\nshould be enabled for any series that should auto-populate. Manual Nos. can be enabled if you want to\nallow  users  to  override  with  their  own  numbering  on  occasion  (commonly  left  off  for  transactional\ndocuments to preserve sequence integrity).\nEnsure no required series is left unassigned in setup \u2013 otherwise, posting those documents will error. The\nManual Setup page in BC can list any missing number series assignments.\nConfiguration Templates for Master Data\nBusiness Central (latest version) uses Templates to help create master records (Customers, Vendors, Items,\netc.)  with  default  field  values.  In  older  versions  these  were  under  \u201cConfiguration  Templates\u201d  (",
  "Table 8618": "Table\n8618/8619), but now they are more user-friendly pages like  Customer Templates (",
  "Table 1381": "Table 1381),  Vendor\nTemplates,  Item Templates, etc. We will address them generally as  Configuration Templates \u2013 the\nconcept is to define a template with certain field defaults to apply when creating a new record. \nTemplates save time and enforce consistency. For example, a Domestic Customer template might auto-fill the\nCustomer Posting Group, General Business Posting Group, Tax Area Code, Payment Terms, etc., for any new\ndomestic customer.\n51\nBelow, we go through common templates and fields you\u2019d set in each. (Field names in templates match the\nfield on the record.) Typically, you\u2019ll create multiple templates per table if needed (e.g. a Domestic vs\nInternational customer template).\nCustomer Templates\nWhen you create a new Customer, BC can prompt to apply a Customer Template. Out-of-box, you might\ncreate templates like \u201cDOMESTIC\u201d and \u201cINTERNATIONAL\u201d or templates by customer type (Retail, Wholesale,\netc.). For each template, consider setting:\nCustomer Posting Group \u2013 Default grouping for the receivables account. E.g. for Domestic\ncustomers, maybe \u201cDOMESTIC\u201d posting group links to a domestic A/R account. For international,\nperhaps a different posting group if you segregate receivables. Generally, in US, all go to one A/R\naccount, so one posting group (e.g. \u201cDOMESTIC\u201d for all). If the client tracks different A/R accounts\n(not common), set accordingly. Default: Use a single \u201cDOMESTIC\u201d or \u201cCUSTOMER\u201d group for all,\nunless needed otherwise.\nGen. Business Posting Group \u2013 Default tax/revenue group for the customer. For US, you might still\nuse something like \u201cDOMESTIC\u201d here to drive sales accounts together with Gen. Product Posting\nGroup in the posting setup. If you have separate groups for Export (no sales tax) vs Domestic (sales\ntax), you could have templates set Gen. Bus. Posting Group to \u201cEXPORT\u201d for international template\n(and in posting setup map that to perhaps a different sales revenue if needed, or just treat tax\ndifferently). Typically: one Gen. Bus. PG for all customers, unless you differentiate by market\nsegment or tax logic.\nTax Area Code \u2013 Very important for US. The template can set a default Tax Area Code (which\nrepresents the customer\u2019s sales tax jurisdiction). For example, a template for in-state customers\nmight default Tax Area = your state (so state sales tax applies). For out-of-state, maybe a\n\u201cOUTOFSTATE\u201d tax area with no taxes (if not charging tax out of state). If the client mostly sells\ntaxable in their state, the default template could set that state\u2019s tax area. Users can change per\ncustomer as needed. Alternatively, leave it blank in template and require user to choose based on\nthe customer\u2019s address. Recommended: If most customers fall under one tax area (e.g. all in-home\nstate), set it; otherwise, leave blank but don\u2019t forget to fill on each customer.\nTax Liable \u2013 In US, generally Yes for customers where you must charge sales tax (tax areas\ndetermine the rate). The template for taxable customers should have Tax Liable = TRUE so that sales\ntax will calculate. If you have a template for, say, Resellers or Out-of-State (where you don\u2019t collect\ntax), set Tax Liable = FALSE in that template (and possibly also assign a \u201cNON\u201d tax area or blank area).\nThis ensures no tax is calculated for those. \nPayment Terms Code \u2013 Default customer payment terms (e.g. NET30). If the majority of your\ncustomers are Net 30, the template should default that. You might have another template for\ncustomers with different terms (e.g. COD or Net 60).\nPayment Method Code \u2013 If commonly used (e.g. \u201cCHECK\u201d or \u201cACH\u201d to denote how they pay), set a\ndefault. Not mandatory, but can be helpful.\nShipping Method Code \u2013 If most customers use a default shipping method (like \u201cGROUND\u201d), you\ncan set it. Often left blank as it varies per order.\nShipment Terms Code \u2013 If applicable (e.g. FOB). Template can default FOB=Origin or similar if most\nare the same.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n52\nLocation Code (for orders) \u2013 If the company has multiple shipping warehouses and typically a\ncertain group of customers is served from one, a template could set a default Location Code for their\norders. Usually blank unless you segment by region and location.\nCurrency Code \u2013 If you deal with foreign customers frequently and invoice in their currency, a\ntemplate for that scenario could set the Currency Code (e.g. \u201cEUR\u201d for a European customer\ntemplate). Domestic template would leave blank for USD (LCY).\nLanguage Code \u2013 If printing documents in another language for certain customers, the template\ncould set that (e.g. FR for French, so their invoice prints in French if language captions are set). \nFin. Charge Terms / Reminder Terms \u2013 If you use late payment fee calculations, you can assign\ndefault terms for finance charges and reminders. If not, leave blank.\nCash Flow Payment Terms Code \u2013 For cash flow forecasting, if they use a different payment\nexpectation than actual Payment Terms, could set. Not commonly changed, usually mirrors Payment\nTerms.\nInvoice Disc. Code \u2013 If invoice discounts are set up by customer group, you might set this to e.g.\n\u201cSTANDARD\u201d so the customer gets those discounts. Many small businesses don\u2019t use invoice discount\ncodes; they might use Payment Terms to give early-payment discounts instead.\nCustomer Price Group / Customer Disc. Group \u2013 If pricing or discounts are categorized, you could\nhave templates default these. For instance, a \u201cRetail Customer\u201d template might set Price Group =\nRETAIL (though typically price groups are assigned per campaign or manually). Use if applicable.\nSalesperson Code \u2013 If most new customers are handled by a particular salesperson (or you create\ntemplates per sales region), set the default here. Otherwise leave blank to force user to pick the\nresponsible salesperson on the customer.\nTerritory Code \u2013 Similar to Salesperson; if using Territory for reporting, maybe default to a main\nterritory or leave blank and assign manually.\nCredit Limit (LCY) \u2013 If the client extends a standard default credit limit to all new customers (say\n$5,000), you can put that in the template. It will copy to the Customer Card (and you can adjust per\ncustomer later). If they evaluate credit case-by-case, leave it zero or a nominal amount and let users\nfill in.\nBlocked \u2013 The template can mark new customers as initially Blocked (e.g. for review). Typically you\nwouldn\u2019t block by default unless the policy is every new customer is on hold until credit check.\nUsually leave it unblocked (No) for normal templates.\nDimension Values \u2013 You can assign default global or shortcut dimensions via the template (e.g. a\nCUSTOMER GROUP dimension might default to \u201cINDIVIDUAL\u201d vs \u201cBUSINESS\u201d based on template).\nBC\u2019s template lets you set up associated default dimensions\n. If the client uses dimensions like\nRegion or CustomerType, link them in the template for consistency.\nEmail / Phone / Address fields \u2013 Those will be entered per customer, usually not in template (except\nmaybe country code if all domestic, you could default Country = US in template to save a step).\nOnce templates are defined, when a user creates a new customer, they select the appropriate template and\nall these fields pre-populate\n. This greatly speeds up data entry and ensures accounting fields are\ncorrectly set. \nFor example, using a Domestic Customer template with Tax Liable = Yes, Tax Area = [HomeState], Posting\nGroups = DOMESTIC, Payment Terms = NET30, etc., means every new U.S. customer starts with those\ndefaults and only unique info (name, address, credit limit) needs entry.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n31\n\u2022 \n32\n33\n53\nVendor Templates\nSimilar to customers, set up Vendor Templates for common vendor types. Fields to consider defaulting:\nVendor Posting Group \u2013 Typically \u201cVENDORS\u201d (mapping to Accounts Payable account). If multiple AP\naccounts (rare), templates accordingly (e.g. DOMESTIC vs FOREIGN AP accounts).\nGen. Business Posting Group \u2013 Might use \u201cVENDOR\u201d or \u201cDOMESTIC\u201d (mostly relevant if you use this\nto differentiate input tax or expense grouping; often all vendors share one group).\nPurchaser Code \u2013 If a procurement person is usually associated, could default.\nPayment Terms Code \u2013 e.g. NET30 as default payment terms you have with suppliers. If some\nvendors (like utilities) are always due on receipt, maybe a separate template.\nPayment Method Code \u2013 e.g. CHEQUE for print checks by default, or Electronic. If most vendors are\npaid by check in US, maybe default \u201cCHECK\u201d. Or if encouraging ACH, default \u201cACH\u201d. Can always\nchange per vendor.\nTax Liable (Sales Tax liable on purchases) \u2013 In US, this is usually False because businesses typically\nprovide resale or exemption certificates to vendors for items they resell, and for expenses you either\naccrue use tax or not. However, BC\u2019s purchase tax calculation is often not used heavily in US (instead,\ncompanies pay vendor invoices that include sales tax and treat it as expense, or self-accrue use tax\noutside BC). If the client uses BC to accrue Use Tax on purchases, you\u2019d set Tax Liable = TRUE on\nvendors where you need to calculate use tax (and assign a Tax Area Code for use tax). Otherwise,\nleave Tax Liable false (so system doesn\u2019t compute tax on vendor invoices). So a \u201cTaxable Vendor\u201d\ntemplate might be rarely used. You might have a template for \u201cOut-of-State Vendor\u201d if you self-\nassess use tax, with Tax Area = your state use tax and Tax Liable = true \u2013 but many companies handle\nthat offline. Consult their tax approach.\nTax Area Code \u2013 Only if calculating tax on purchases in-system. Often left blank or set to a default\n\u201cUSE-TAX\u201d area if implementing use tax. Otherwise, not commonly set.\nIRS 1099 Code \u2013 If you track 1099s, you might set a default 1099 Form/Box on vendor templates. For\nexample, a \u201cService Vendor\u201d template could set 1099 Code = MISC-07 (for services) so that any new\nservice vendor is flagged for 1099s. Or a \u201cCorp Vendor\u201d template might leave 1099 blank. This helps\nensure you don\u2019t forget to mark vendors for 1099 if needed.\nCurrency Code \u2013 If you have foreign vendors, a template for them can set the Currency (e.g. CAD for\nCanadian vendor template).\nLanguage Code \u2013 If sending POs in another language to vendor, set if needed.\nShipment Method Code \u2013 Rare for purchasing, but if you always use certain freight terms for POs\nby default (like a default shipping agent).\nLocation Code \u2013 If company has multiple receiving locations and a vendor template is specific to\none location\u2019s sourcing, could set, but typically leave blank so purchasing decides per order.\nBlocked \u2013 Could default new vendors as Blocked=Payments or All, pending approval. But usually\nnew vendors are active.\nDimensions \u2013 If using a dimension like Department or Project to tag expenses by vendor type, you\ncould preset. E.g. a \u201cSubcontractor\u201d vendor template might set Department = Production by default,\netc. However, dimensions often are assigned on the transaction rather than vendor card, unless a\nvendor always goes to one dimension.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n54\nItem Templates\nItems often need more setup, and templates are extremely useful to ensure consistency. You may create\nmultiple item templates based on item type or product group. For instance: Resale Item, Manufactured\nItem, Service Item, Non-Inventory Item, etc. Fields to default:\nItem Type \u2013 Inventory vs Service vs Non-Inventory. For example, a \u201cService Item\u201d template would set\nType = Service (since it\u2019s not a physical stock item). A \u201cNon-Inventory\u201d template sets Non-Inventory\ntype for things you don\u2019t track quantity on. Regular products would be Inventory.\nItem Category Code \u2013 If using item categories for grouping, a template can set this. For example, a\ntemplate per item category ensures that category is assigned. Item Category can itself default some\nvalues to the item (like default UoM, posting group) if configured \u2013 but an item template can cover\nmore.\nBase Unit of Measure \u2013 What UoM is the item stocked in. Many companies have a default like EACH.\nIf so, template can set Base UoM = EA (each). You might have different templates if some items\ndefault to different UoM (like a template for liquids with GAL gallon, etc.).\nSales UOM / Purchase UOM \u2013 If typically same as base, template can set them equal to Base Unit of\nMeasure. If not, could specify if known (or leave blank to default to Base).\nInventory Posting Group \u2013 Critical for inventory items. This ties the item to the correct inventory G/\nL accounts (Inventory, COGS, etc.). Often one posting group for all (e.g. \u201cRAW\u201d or \u201cFIN\u201d or just \u201cINV\u201d).\nSome companies split by product type (e.g. \u201cRETAIL\u201d items vs \u201cMATERIAL\u201d items hitting different\nCOGS accounts). Use templates accordingly: e.g. FG Item template sets Posting Group = FG (finished\ngoods), Raw Material template sets = RAW. If all items use same accounts, just one group (e.g. ALL)\ncan be defaulted in all templates.\nGen. Product Posting Group \u2013 This along with Gen. Bus. PG defines revenue/COGS accounts.\nCommonly set to e.g. \u201cRESALE\u201d for goods you sell, or different codes by item type if separating sales\naccounts (e.g. \u201cPARTS\u201d vs \u201cSERVICE\u201d revenue). Templates should set appropriate Prod. Posting Group.\nFor example, a Service Item template would set Gen. Prod. Posting Group = SERVICES (so that sales\nof that item hit a service revenue account) while a Resale Item template sets it to, say, RETAIL or\nPRODUCT revenue. Ensure consistency with how the G/L accounts are mapped in General Posting\nSetup.\nVAT Prod. Posting Group \u2013 For US, this might be \u201cTAXABLE\u201d or \u201cNONTAX\u201d if using VAT groups for\nsales tax. Actually, BC (US) uses Tax Groups on item cards (in Tax Setup, separate from VAT Prod.\nPosting Group). The VAT Prod. Posting Group likely isn\u2019t used in US locale if Sales Tax is enabled;\ninstead, we use Tax Group Code on the item. So: if using sales tax, set Tax Group Code in templates\n(e.g. \u201cTAXABLE\u201d for most items, meaning this item is subject to sales tax) or \u201cEXEMPT\u201d if selling that\nitem is usually exempt. By default, BC might consider all items Taxable unless specified. So having\nthe template set Tax Group = TAXABLE ensures proper tax calc on sales. For non-taxable items\n(maybe services in some states), a different template can set a non-taxable tax group.\nCosting Method \u2013 For inventory items, default as configured in Inventory Setup (likely FIFO or\nAverage). Templates can override if needed. For example, a Manufactured Item template might\ndefault Standard Cost method (because you plan to define standard costs), whereas a Purchased\nItem template might default FIFO. Decide based on how they manage costs: many US distributors\nuse FIFO or Average for all; manufacturers often use Standard for finished goods. Create templates\naccordingly.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n55\nBase Unit Cost / Standard Cost \u2013 Usually left blank in template (costs will be input per item).\nException: if a Standard Cost template, you might put a dummy standard cost (like $0 or some\naverage) just so the field isn\u2019t blank, but likely better to leave for user to enter real cost.\nPrice/Profit fields \u2013 Leave blank; those are item-specific.\nReplenishment System \u2013 If the item is usually Purchased or Produced. Templates can set \nReplenishment = Purchase for bought items (and even default a preferred Vendor No. if most items\nfrom same vendor \u2013 but that\u2019s rare; better to leave vendor blank for user to fill). For finished goods,\nset Replenishment = Prod. (and maybe default a Production BOM and Routing if using same BOM for\nmany? Unlikely \u2013 those are usually unique per item). If using Assembly Management for kitting,\nmaybe a template with Replenishment = Assembly.\nLead Time Calculation \u2013 If most purchased items have e.g. 7D lead time, template can set Lead\nTime = 7D. Or set a typical manufacturing lead time on produced item template. Can save time\nrather than entering on each item.\nManufacturing Policy \u2013 For produced items, templates might set policy to Make-to-Stock or Make-\nto-Order depending on typical. If majority one way, set it.\nFlushing Method \u2013 Template can set the item\u2019s default flushing method for components or output.\nE.g. a \u201cRaw Material\u201d template might set Flushing = Backward (if these are usually backflushed). If\nsome components are always manual, you\u2019d adjust item-by-item, so template can use the common\nscenario.\nLot/Serial Tracking Code \u2013 If certain item categories are always lot or serial tracked, the template\ncould assign a default Item Tracking Code. For example, a template for \u201cLot Tracked Item\u201d sets\nTracking Code = LOTALL (assuming that code requires lot numbers on all transactions). If most items\nare not tracked, default template leaves it blank (no tracking).\nDimensions \u2013 If items carry default dimensions (like an Item Category dimension), you can set via\ntemplate. E.g. an \u201cOffice Supplies\u201d template might set Global Dimension 1 = ADMIN (so that revenue\nfrom those items defaults to admin department).\nBlocked \u2013 Usually No in template, unless you want new items to start as blocked for sales until fully\nset up (some companies do that). Typically, you leave new items unblocked so they can be used.\nVariants \u2013 If the template is for an item that will have variants (e.g. apparel), there\u2019s no direct field to\npre-create variants via template, but you could indicate that multiple variants might be needed (the\nuser would still define them after creating the item).\nItem Template Code \u2013 Note that BC allows assigning an \u201cItem Template\u201d code on customer or sales\ndocuments for quick apply, but here we\u2019re focusing on creation templates.\nIn BC 2023, when you click \u201cNew Item\u201d, it will ask for a template (if more than one exists) or automatically\napply one if only one. After the item is created, the template can also apply Default Dimensions via the\n\u201cDimensions\u201d button on the template setup\n.\nOther Templates:\nContact Templates: If maintaining standalone contacts (like leads or business relations separate\nfrom customers/vendors), you might have a template for Person vs Company. Fields: Type\n(Company/Person), perhaps default Country/Region or communication defaults. Not heavily used\nunless doing a lot of lead management.\nEmployee Templates: If using Employees (for time sheets or jobs), a template could default their\nposting group or some HR settings. But employees typically require less accounting setup; you may\nskip templates or have a simple one for new employees.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n34\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n56\nResource Templates: If using Resources (in jobs or service), you might create templates for types of\nresources (e.g. Labor vs Equipment) to default cost/profit calculations or posting groups. E.g. a\n\u201cLabor Resource\u201d template might set Resource Type = Person and a specific Resource Group.\nBank Account Templates: Possibly, if adding many bank accounts, a template could default the\ncurrency (like USD), Bank Posting Group, etc.\nIn summary, configuration templates are a way to encapsulate best-practice field values for each master\ndata type. Take time to create these for any field where a default choice will apply to many records \u2013 it both\nspeeds up data entry and reduces errors. The user can always override a template value on a specific\nrecord, but having templates apply consistent initial values helps a lot.\nOnce templates are set, test by creating a new record via the template to ensure all desired fields populate.\nFor instance, create a dummy customer with the Domestic template and verify that posting groups, tax\narea, etc., are indeed filled in as expected. Adjust the template if something is missing.\nFinally, be aware that template application can be automated during data migration (RapidStart packages\ncan use templates to fill certain fields on import). So these templates not only assist interactive user entry\nbut also bulk imports of master data.\nUsing Templates in BC:\nWhen adding a new customer/vendor/item, the system will ask to choose a template (if one exists)\n. If only one template exists, it may auto-apply it\n.\nYou can maintain templates via the Customer Templates page (same for Vendor, Item, etc.). You can\nalso create a template from an existing record by the action \u201cSave as Template\u201d (which is handy: fill\none record properly, then save as template to reuse its setup).\nTemplates also allow copying dimensions as noted. After applying a template, you can still modify\nthe new record\u2019s fields as needed.\nTemplate Example:\nFor clarity, here\u2019s an example Customer Template called DOMESTIC:\nCode: DOMESTIC, Description: Domestic Customers\nCustomer Posting Group = DOMESTIC (maps to standard A/R account)\nGen. Bus. Posting Group = DOMESTIC (for tax/revenue mapping)\nTax Liable = Yes\nTax Area Code = NY (assuming company based in New York; this tax area has NY state tax %)\nPayment Terms = 30D (Net 30 days)\nPayment Method = CHECK\n1099 Code = (blank, as usually customers aren\u2019t 1099 \u2013 that\u2019s for vendors)\nFin. Charge Terms = STD (if standard terms for late fees are set)\nSalesperson Code = JSMITH (could assign default salesperson)\nDimension Dept = SALES (meaning revenue from these customers defaults to Sales dept)\nResult: When this template is applied to a new customer, all above fields fill in. The user then just\nenters customer name, address, maybe specific Tax Area if not NY, and credit limit. This ensures\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n33\n32\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n57\nevery new customer has the needed setup to correctly post sales (to the right accounts, with tax\ncalculation on, etc.) without the user having to remember to set each field.\nIn conclusion, define configuration templates to reflect the common scenarios in the client\u2019s business. It\u2019s\nbetter to have a few extra templates than to have users manually toggling fields incorrectly. Templates can\nbe updated later; changes won\u2019t affect already-created records (they\u2019re just a starting point), but new\nrecords will get the updated values.\nSources:\nThe concept of default posting groups and their effect is detailed in Microsoft\u2019s docs. \nCredit warning options for customers are described in official guidance. \nAutomatic cost posting and adjustment recommendations are per Microsoft\u2019s best practices.\nTemplate usage is highlighted in the BC Training material, which suggests how templates save time\nin data entry\n. \nWe also refer to built-in tooltips and experiences in the BC UI for many of these fields. \nTable \"Purchases & Payables\nSetup\" | Microsoft Learn\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/application/base-application/table/\nmicrosoft.purchases.setup.purchases-&-payables-setup\nViewing Purchase Orders after posting and received\nhttps://community.dynamics.com/forums/thread/details/?threadid=225dd8a1-c0bf-4bbc-8e08-db0bd1c70edf\nTable \"Sales & Receivables Setup\" | Microsoft Learn\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/application/base-application/table/microsoft.sales.setup.sales-\n&-receivables-setup\nTable \"Warehouse Setup\" | Microsoft Learn\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/application/base-application/table/\nmicrosoft.warehouse.setup.warehouse-setup\nManaging Fixed Assets in Dynamics NAV - The NAV People\nhttps://www.the365people.com/blog/fixed-assets-in-dynamics-nav\nDynamics 365 Business Central: Do more with Customer and Vendor Templates \u2013\nDvlprLife.com\nhttps://www.dvlprlife.com/2022/08/apply-those-master-templates/\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n32\n33\n\u2022 \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n24\n13\n22\n23\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n58"
